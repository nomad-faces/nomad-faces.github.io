About the Project

The rise of digital nomadism is rapidly transforming culturally rich cities into hubs of remote work, creating economic shifts and cultural tensions. The Faces of a Modern Nomad is an interactive story that delves into the cultural and economic impact of this growing movement. The story profiles three individuals who embody this movement, illustrating the diverse motivations, experiences, and consequences tied to this global trend. The narrative blends data visualization with storytelling to provide a nuanced look at the evolving relationship between digital nomads and local communities.




Data Sources

The story cites data from the Nomads.com 2025 Nomad List. In addition to this, we also use live currency-exchange rates from the ExchangeRate-API to highlight the purchasing power of digital nomads, a majority of who happen to be from the United States.
